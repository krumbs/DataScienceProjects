## Project 1: ClassifyExoPlanet
A Kaggle competition inspired project titled "Exoplanet Hunting in Deep Space" using Kepler labelled time series data. See link https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data/home for details.

Choice of ML model:
1. CNN
Available examples of Exoplanet data is very scarce in the training set so some data augmentation is applied.

Choice of augmentation schemes:
1. flip time series data on randomly selected batch generated data.
2. add Gaussian noise on randomly selected batch generated data.
